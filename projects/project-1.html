				<a>RESEARCH</a>
				<p>While questioning my interviewees (all of different backgrounds and 
				interests), I came to the conclusion that none of them have ever used the
				Towson galleries website, even the people that were art majors. My general
				consensus as to why based off of the answers I was given was because it's
				marginally useless. It has hours, but most of the people that go to the 
				galleries go in between classes, and it has relatively normal business 
				hours. Some important things that must be included are the hours and the
				location and a short bio, all of which is already included. What needs to 
				be improved is the description of the locations. What needs to be added is
				accountable contact information and more photos of the exhibits and 
				student work, with interesting background info on the artists and exhibits.
				This would also help promote the artists and give them ways to share their
				work through social media. The website is also never talked about or
				promoted by teachers or Towson. If it is constantly updated and has 
				relevant news, then it will be used and reach more people.

				<a>INSPIRATION</a>
				
				<p></p>
			
					<a href="http://www.moma.org">MoMA website</a>
					<p>I loved the way that the page is mostly a slideshow of pictures to
						get the viewer interested, as well as the pictures of the location info.<p>
					<a href="https://www.artbma.org">BMA website</a>
					<p>This design is visually appealing, while also being easy to navigate.<p>
					<a href="http://www.mattress.org/">The Mattress Factory website</a>
					<p>Like the MoMA website, the main feature of the home page is pictures
					and information of upcoming exhibit.</p>
