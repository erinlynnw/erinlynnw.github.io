		<p>This format is very unique and memorable. I like how you are able to see alot 
of the artist's work all at once, just by scrolling around. Being able to simultaneously
view images and video is also a bonus. It is minimalist in the sense of 
only the important text (the artist's contact info) is shown right away while letting his
work speak for itself.</p>
