		<p>This site is yet again another example of a great one-page scroll format. It's very 
		image based, which would be great for a portfolio like mine. Again, I like how the graphics
		scrolled over a background image, but still presented plenty of info for an easy to
		use format. I like how all of the buttons are very interactive and gives you plenty to 
		look at.</p>
