		<p>I love the navigation aspect of this website. Using the spacebar and/or
		the swipe pad to see almost the story of this website is very visually appealing 
		easy to use, while being unique as well. I also didn't mind the lack of photos, 
		because I feel as though that could make the page too busy. I'd like to find out
		how to develop a website with a spacebar page navigation.</p>
