		<h2><a href="http://www.lilyallenmusic.com">Lily Allen Music Website</a><h2>
		<p>My favorite part of this website is the home page. simplistic yet grand, all it
		contains is the artist's logo and a search bar, with ornate branded decorations and a 
		button to buy the music. I just love how the brick wall you're apparently looking at from the outside
		has shadows that move across it, giving the appearance of actually looking at a wall
		shaded by trees. small movement (GIFS) on a homescreen is a really interesting idea 
		I'd like to use.</p>
