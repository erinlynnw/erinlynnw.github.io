		<p>I love how unique the navigation is for this website, as well as how everything
		kind of hits you at once while you look at it. Since cartoons aren't really
		my thing I would love to see how this looks with photographs, as my portfolio
		homepage. This grabbed my attention right away and I wanted to keep playing 
		with it and seeing more. I was afraid that it would be easy to get lost with
		such an obscure navigation component but when you leave the home page the next
		page reboots, changes color so you know you're on another page, and an X appears
		that takes you back to the homepage when you're finished with your selection. For
		added efficiency there is also an expandable menu bar on the sub-pages.</p>
