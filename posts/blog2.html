		<p>The fullscreen images that you first see are very visually pleasing, and I 
		like how they are moving images. The main thing that Speedo wants you to view is 
		video, which you can easily play without leaving the homepage. There are more
		videos located under a small simple tab bar that then project the chosen video 
		onto the main screen, shifting the focus. It's simple yet very appealing.</p>
