		">Lauren Wickware Design Website</a><h2>
		<p>This website has an absolutely beautiful layout that really focuses on the images
		of her work, which is one of the most important things to be shown on an artist's website.
		I also really liked the info page, because any information a client would need is
		there, all on one page but laid out nicely.</p>
