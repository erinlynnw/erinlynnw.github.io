		<p>And once more, this is another one page scroll through site that is probably my favorite 
		so far. I love how when you scroll it manipulates the main images and is mostly very
		image heavy and graphic. There is just alot of bright intriguing things going on
		and it seems like a great portfolio resource even if this is for a music artist</p>
